3. 配置规则参考（主要真的同时配置多个标签的情况）

    Supported operators
    The following operators are supported, in descending order of precedence:
    (expression)
    parentheses — used to explicitly define the associativity of an expression
    !expression
    NOT — negation; the result of expression must not be true
    a && b
    AND — both of the expressions a and b must be true
    a || b
    OR — either of the expressions a or b may be true
    a -> b
    "implies" operator — equivalent to !a || b.
    For example, windows -> x64 could be thought of as "if a Windows agent is used, then that agent must be 64-bit", while still allowing this project to be executed on any agents that do not have the windows label, regardless of whether they have also have an x64 label
    a <-> b
    "if and only if" operator — equivalent to a && b || !a && !b
    For example, windows <-> dc2 could be thought of as "if a Windows agent is used, then that agent must be in datacenter 2, but if a non-Windows agent is used, then it must not be in datacenter 2"
